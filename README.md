##Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repository hosts project files submitted for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset.

####Source data used for the project:
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset form the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  The dataset was built from the recording of 30 subjects performing activities while wearing a smart phone with embeded sensors.  Further details about the dataset can be found at the website where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

####Repo contents:
* README.md : Provides an overview of the repository contents
* run_analysis.R : An R script used to prepare tidy data from the source dataset.
* CodeBook.md: A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data.
* tidyHARdata.txt : Output file (tidy data) created by running the R script, run_analysis.R.

####Overview of the R script
The script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
* Downloads the source dataset from the UCI website and unzips it into the working directory
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Genetates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject pair.
